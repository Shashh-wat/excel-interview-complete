🚀 INTEGRATION INSTRUCTIONS:

Option 1 - Quick Fix (Recommended):
1. Edit your main.py imports section
2. Change this line:
   from fixed_murf_client import FixedMurfAPIClient, FixedVoiceService
   
   To this:
   from simple_working_voice import MurfAPIClient as FixedMurfAPIClient, VoiceService as FixedVoiceService

3. Restart: python main.py

Option 2 - Environment Variable:
1. Add to your .env file:
   DEFAULT_VOICE_ID={WORKING_VOICE}
   
2. In main.py, after creating murf_client:
   murf_client.default_voice_id = os.getenv('DEFAULT_VOICE_ID', '{WORKING_VOICE}')

Option 3 - Direct Edit:
1. Edit fixed_murf_client.py line with default_voice_id
2. Change to: self.default_voice_id = "{WORKING_VOICE}"
3. Restart server

🎯 Working Voice ID: {WORKING_VOICE}
